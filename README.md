Rimworld mod that adds several items and weapons to interact with its psychic aspect.
This mod adds seven weapons and two additional items that require specific psycasts to interact with. Most of the additions have non-standard functionality, and several of them have a psychic cost associated with their use. My goal is for this to make psychic characters feel somwhat more special, and hopefully not add too much bloat in the process.

Compatibility:
- Combat Extended: Does not work with combat extended, and I have no current plans to fix that.
- Simple Sidearms: Technicaly works together, but sidearms ignore the psychic requirements of the weapons. You can either add the weapons to the fobidden list in SS or choose to use pocket sand instead.
- Run and Gun: Patched to disallow certain weapons to be used with run and gun, and should otherwise work normally.
